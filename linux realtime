Real Time :


##############################################################################DAY 1 ===>

Customer - who provide the business to service based company - like HCL, IBM,NTT, TCS.

Product based - like Amazon, google, Microsoft, Facebook .
Service Based company .. who provide the support to the customer based on agreement.

project - nothing but customer product/business.

#### ITIL Process ######

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a set of practices and processes designed to help organizations manage and deliver IT services.

SLA - Service Level Agreement.

BU head - Business Unit head.

=> Tickets - nothing to do something with respect to request.

-> Incident management.
-> Change Management.
-> Problem Management.

-> Project Tasks

Service Request:

-> Incident management: 
===================================================
Alerts - Auto generated ticket by monitoring tool 
User created incident  - User created incident 
Service Request - User created requests.


Monitoring tool : it monitor the servers on 24/7 


Threshold - > in the server level they will set some % of the threshold limit on the monitoring tool. Once breached alert will generate.

Like .. 

File system - usage 80%
CPU - 80%
Memory - 80%
Load Averages - x%
App/DB services

Ticketing Tool - To check / track the all the tickets (incident/changes/problem tasks) - Service Now, BMC Remedy.
CMDB : CMDB (Configuration Management Database)

Servers : Dev & QA & PRODUCTION.
SLA :

Incident (Alert/user created) - 

P1 - Need to assign in 5 Minutes and need to resolve the issue with in 2/4 hours.
P2 - Need to assign in 15 Minutes and need to resolve the issue with in 1 day.
P3 - Need to assign in 1 hours and need to resolve the issue with in 3 days.
P4 - Need to assign in 2 hours and need to resolve the issue with in 7 days.

Service Request : No SLA , need to work an resolve the issue based the time.


P1/P2 - Incident management team will initiate a bridge call and loop all the required teams. 

1) issue need to resolved with in the SLA.
2) if issue not fixed need to take customer approval and extend the window to resolve the issue.
3) If issue resolved , we need to provide the RCA to customer.

RCA ( Root cause analysis).


-> Change Management:
==========================

It is to perform the changes when required to make a changes on the servers.

-> Normal changes
-> emergency changes.
-> standard changes 
-> expedite changes 


Business Hours : Customer business running hours.

Change activity - planned activity

Online activities , offline activities, critical …

Approval - every change request need approvals to perform the activity.
CAB Approvals - Need to present the change in cab meeting to review the tech-plan.
If not get approvals for change , we will not implement the change as per the schedule and it need to rescheduled.
Make sure implement the change request in schedule time only. 


-> Normal changes/ Standard changes:

- To perform the regular activities as per the window.
- if server is NON-PROD need to create the change in 3 days before.
- If server is PROD need to create the change in 7 days before.

-> Emergency changes.
- change need to create based on P1 tickets or if any critical issues/ priority issues.

-> Expedite changes
- Need to create the changes for emergency tasks  or priority activities to make the changes at server level.

Lead time  --> means process defined to raise a changes, if change not met the lead time , they will not approve the changes.

Server Types :
----------------

- Production 
- Pre-PROD
- Non- Production.

- > Production , QA , Testing , Development Servers.


In case if change implementation is success  and technical implement is failed. during the time PCR will be generated

PCR - Problem Change Request - we need to explain to change management that why change has been failed to implement successfully.

-> Problem Management.
---------------------------

- Problem tickets will be created to provide the RCA for the issues based on the P1 tickets.
- Then we need to prepare the RCA sheet/template and need to send to problem management team.
- they will review the document and share to the client. if customer is happy with RCA then problem ticket can be closed.
- If customer is not happy with the RCA, then again we need to work on the RCA.

=> Working vendors:
--------------------

When even we facing the issues on the server if we unable to find the issue , the new need to raise a case with vendor .. like red hat, oracle, HP, Dell etc … to get the solution or RCA for it. 

Redhat Linux/Linux : 
- need to generate the sos report 
# sosreport   ---  the command to run
- attach in the case 

URL --> https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/04182654

WINSCP - it is the tool to copy the data from server to local desktop


=> Performance Issues :
--------------------------

System level slowness issues or system behaviour is abnormal.

-> application user will create a ticket to Linux team 
-> Unix resource need to assign the ticket and work on it.
-> As part of the troubleshooting we need to analyse the issue and provide the proper RCA to Application user/requester/client.

-- if application team face the any kind of slowness or connectivity interruption on the application level.
-- Linux team need to troubleshoot the issue and need to check in the server level.

1) Need to check load balance on the system # top  or # uptime
2) Need to check the CPU and memory usage ,  Io stats, IO wait , load average on the server.
3) Need to check the disk usage of the file system / NFS shares if data is running it.
4) if in case issue was exists in one before we need to check the sar reports.

# cd /var/log/sa/;ls -l
# sysstat-10.1.5-20.el7_9.x86_64  - package to be installed to generate the sar files

# sar -r -f sa27 - cpu
# sar -q -f sa27 - cpu

- if you find any issues server level related to the process consumption , need to inform app team.

-- If at all issue not find from our end, then we need to raise case vendor to I identify the issue/RCA for it.
-- Please follow the above process for raising a case with vendor.


=> File permissions/Ownership Permissions :
--------------------------------------------

- If you want to give permissions to any user or file you need ticket for that.
- With out ticket never change any permissions at server level.
- Properly validate the access part.
- Need to check whether he is a valid user to provide the permissions to the file/folder.
- Never replace the access with another user, which means that when provide the access to new user it will not impact to existing the user permissions.
- if user need access please also provide the access with special permissions like ACL.


=> Access Management/User Management :
-------------------------------------->

- user types

1) AD user  - Active directory
2) LDAP user
3) PAM user
4) local user.
5) IPA


Active Directory :
------------------
AD - To allow Active Directory (AD) users to log into a Linux system, you’ll need to integrate your Linux machine with your AD domain. This setup lets users authenticate using their Windows credentials. Here's how to do it on most modern Linux distributions like RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, or Debian.

- User does not exist in the server and coming from AD.
- Access will granted based security groups related your team.
- AD will be manage by windows team and user will created by windows team.
- to provide the Linux user for multiple server user will be added to AD level to security group.
_ so access will manage from Domain level.

[root@msp- ~]# id srikanth.pulukuri
uid=27358(srikanth.pulukuri) gid=65535(none) groups=2000(s24_linuxeng),1050(awesome),2006(linuxeng),2918(dev-env_puppet_operators),65535(none)
[root@msp- ~]#


LDAP :

To manage LDAP users on a Linux system, you typically use OpenLDAP along with tools like ldapadd, ldapsearch, and ldappasswd. Here's a quick guide to help you get started.

- LDAP also user will connect to the serve remotely.
- user does not existt in the server 
- access manage by LDAP teams.
- to provide the Linux user for multiple server user will be added to LDAP level to security group.


# id srikanth.pulukuri
uid=1421000459(srikanth.pulukuri) gid=1421000459(srikanth.pulukuri) groups=1421000459(srikanth.pulukuri),1421000126(zf_cognos),1421000000(admins),2006(linuxeng)


cat /etc/krb5.conf
cat /etc/sssd/sssd.conf



PAM :   

To manage user access with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) in Linux, you configure rules that control how users authenticate to services like SSH, su, login, and more. PAM provides a flexible, modular system for authentication and authorization.


IPA :

To enable IPA (Identity, Policy, Audit) user authentication in Linux, you typically use FreeIPA, an open-source identity management system that integrates LDAP, Kerberos, DNS, and certificate services. It’s like Active Directory for Linux environments 

- Linux team team will create/delete the user and grant the access.
- password will reset by Linux team.
- Admin access will be provided by Linux team
- login issues also fix by Linux team only.

- we will create 2 servers as IPA servers.
- Once user created on IPA servers automatically user will be on the client servers.
- user does not exists on the server.
- if you want to change the password - in IPA server you need to change and it will be reflect to all the servers.


Please note that --- > if you get any login issue with AD,LDAP,PAM so you need to work with respective team to fix the login issues.


Local user : 

- Linux team team will create/delete the user and grant the access.
- password will reset by Linux team.
- Admin access will be provided by Linux team
- login issues also fix by Linux team only.
- need ticket for user creation/deletion/modify the access.


=> Server Connecting issues:

User is not able to connecting the server and seems has some issues with connectivity.

- need to check the server ping 
- if server is ping it means server is running and up , if not ping means server is down.
- If no ping response, -need to check the status in the console. 
- if server is powered off state.
- is there any activity is going on from any team?.
1) May be Linux is performing some activity or VMWare/OVM/PHY(DC) are doing some activity this need to be checked.
2) VM migration activities, May be decommissioned.
3) check in the mails with server name if may be some activity is going on or not.

- if server is pinging then ..
--- Need to take console and check it whether server is powered on or powered off.
--- if server is on , login to the console and try find the issue.
---  may be issue with consfiguration or service.
--- may be network services are down.
--- need to valodate routing table in the server.
--- if server went to hung state - need to reboot the server with proper approval

[root@ ~]# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         10.118.252.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
10.118.252.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1002   0        0 eth0
[root@ ~]#

---- need to check with cloud team to validate the server, bcz some cases server may be migrated to diffrent ESX host.
---- need to check with networl team if there any issues at Network level.

User login issues :

- Need to verify user is exists in the server or not.
- request user to verify the giving the right password or not.
- need to check if user is active or not, Bcz in some cases user might be locked in the server.
- if user locked,  need to be unlocked.
- if everything fine, but still facing the issues means need to check if user allowed or not.



=> Server Reboot:

-> if get any request to reboot the server, make sure to check with proper approvals is there or not.
-> if get any request for reboot, Please inform requester to get the proper approval to reboot the server.

Approval required : customer approval or application owner or server owner.
-> if need please raise a change request to reboot the server as per the proceed.
- during the implementation request to app/db team to stop the services.
- Take the prechecks in the server like ( take few commands output )
# df -h;uname -r;ifconfig -a;netstat -nr;cat /etc/fstab;cat /etc/resolve.conf;pvs;vgs;lvs
- then reboot the server.
- once server is up inform app/db team to start the services.


=> Resource increase (Memory/Swap, CPU) :
------------------------------------------

Basically when ever we face any performance in the servers as per the request from app/db team we need to increase the resources on the server.
- if app/DB face slowness issues in the server in frequently/regularly in the server then this activity required.
- App/DB team need to raise request to Linux team to perform the resource increase activity.
- App/DB/Linux need to get the proper approval (customer/capacity manager) to increase resource on the server.
- if get proper approvals, need to check with app/DB team to provide the schedule window to proceed the activity.
- we need to check with cloud team to verify whether resource availability is there or not. 
- Need to raise change request to perform the activity.
- during the change implementation.
-> App/DB team need to stop the services.
-> Linux team will power off the server.
-> Cloud team will increase resources and inform Linux team to power on the server or they will power on.
-> once server is up validate the server and inform APP/DB team to start the services.



=> - Daily Alerts and issues:
---------------------------------

We need to monitor the alert on the monitoring tool and assign ticket in bin/queue.
-> how to check the daily issues.
-> to monitor the queue in tool or you may get the mails.
-> in the ticketing tool we need to pick the alerts/tickets and need to work on it and resolve it.

- CPU alerts
- Memory alerts 
- Disk space alerts
- system services related. - check the status of the service and start it.
- user access issues.   - ask them to create ticket for this and fix the access issue.
- user creation requests - ask them to create the ticket and create the user and share the password once set over the mail.
- performance issues  - just follow the process as I have already told you.
- change activities  - perform the activities as per the schedule time.
- problem tickets  - work on RCA part and update them.
- file system issues  - get ticket and work on it.

-> if you get any mail from the user regarding any issues, you need to request them to create ticket for it.

CPU/memory alert 
- validate the server and check the utilization of the server with # top command 
- if any process consuming high utilization drop a mail to respective app/db team to reduce the memory usage.
- Please update the ticket with evidence and assign the ticket to app/DB team.

Disk alerts:

- verify the file system in the server for usage.
- try to clear the some space in the file system to clear the disk space issue.
- In case if the file system related App/DB .. drop a mail to housekeeping the space.
- if unable to clean the space . need to increase file system space.
- if in case there no space to increase the file system in the server , need additional disk to increase it.
- to adding the additional disk we need capacity manager approval to do it.
- if space issue is related to OS file system Linux team need to get the approval for additional disk.
- if space issue is related to APP/DB file systems, then App/DB team  need to get the approval for additional disk.
- we need to raise request to cloud team to get add the new disk and mention the size, and also attaché the approval mail in the request.
- if it is physical machine then need to raise request to storage team.
- if we get the disk , please extend the file system with new disk.




=> File system - Disk adding :
-------------------------

This is to create/Delete/extend the file system on the server.

FS creation :

- Basically if get request to create the file system on the server need to follow the below process.
- Need ticket to create the file system.
- Need disk to create the FS, for that we need capacity manager approval to get the lun/disk.
- So request APP/DB team to get the required approval new disk with 100G.
- Then create a request to storge/clous team to add the new lun/disk.
- Once you get disk follow the technical process to create the file system.

FS extend :

- To extend the file system we need space in VG. if no space available need to get the new Lun.
- if need new disk , get the required approvals.
- Once get approval raise a request to storage/cloud team to add the new disk.
- once get the disk extend the file system as per the technical process.

FS deletion:

- if you get request to remove the file system on the server.
- make sure that, check with concern team to provide the confirmation for deletion.
- make sure that, there will be no data on the file system.
- if any data on the FS, request App/DB to take backup or if backup not required they should confirm over the mail or ticket.
- if required take approval from customer also to remove the file system.
- if multiple file system are running on the same VG , no need to remove any disk from the server.
- accordingly you need to delete the file system on the server as per the technical process.



=> Agent(Package) installations :
------------------------
- agent installations can be done based on the customer requirement.
- we get ticket from customer to for agent install.
- if in case if we get request from any app/db team to install any agent on the server, they need to get approval from customer.
- if you want to install agent/package you need to create change request your self to implement it.
- make sure that , Agent/package need to install on development server first, then QA/Testing, and finally on PROD servers.


=> Booting Issues:
--------------------------

Basically when ever we reboot the machine it will be having the problem to restart the server.

1) ContrlD errors or Filesystem Errors 
2) grub issue
3) Kernel Panic 
4) Initramfs


-> ContrlD errors or Filesystem Errors

if you have issue with file system consistency, server will not boot and get control D error.
If you have wrong entry in /etc/fstab, , server will not boot and get control D error.
it will prompt the error during the reboot, need to give the root password and boot the system in to maintenance mode and fix the issues.
if any wrong entry in /etc/fstab , go to maintenance mode .. edit the fstab file and remove the entry and reboot the server.
if any file system consistency issues, go to maintenance mode- run the fsck for issue file system and reboot the server.

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-determine-and-fix-boot-issues-in-linux

-> GRUB Errors

"GRUB loading." or "GRUB rescue>" prompt: This usually indicates a problem with the GRUB configuration or installation.
Boot from a live Linux environment (USB or DVD). Mount your root partition. 
Reinstall or repair GRUB using the appropriate tools (e.g., grub-install, grub-mkconfig).

-> Kernel Panic

A kernel panic occurs when the kernel encounters a critical error that it cannot recover from. This is often indicated by error messages on the screen and a system halt.

Check recent hardware changes ? If you recently installed new hardware, it might be incompatible or improperly configured.
Check kernel modules ? A faulty or missing kernel module can cause a panic. Try booting with a previous kernel version (if available in GRUB).
Check filesystem integrity ? Filesystem errors can lead to kernel panics. Boot from a live environment and run fsck on your root partition:


-> Initramfs

The initramfs error in Red Hat typically occurs due to a corrupted or missing initial RAM disk image, which is essential for booting the system. This issue can be resolved by regenerating the initramfs file.

Reboot the system and select Rescue Mode from the boot menu. Alternatively, use a bootable Red Hat installation media and choose "Rescue a Red Hat system."
Once in rescue mode, identify your current kernel version using: uname -r
Regenerate the initramfs file using the dracut command: dracut -f /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)
Ensure the new initramfs file exists: ls -l /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img
Reboot the system: reboot


- DR activities:
--------------------

Disaster recovery process.
DC (data centre) will be created for both Live and DR.
Cloud Level - ESX host will created on cluster and VM will be running in between ESX cluster.
OS level also every prod server have a DR server.
DR activities will perform yearly once to test the DR server with PROD.
some cases they will maintain 2 server for one application and it will running on cluster nodes.

=> - Server Build/Commission:
=============================>
This is to deploys the new servers in to the environment as per the customer requirement.

- Project task will be created to all teams to perform the activity.
- if this is VM, Cloud team need to allocate the infra space to build the server.
- mean while network team will allocate the IP address or create the subnet mask for IP Address and open the ports required.
- Linux team need to build the server as per the requirement and create the users , install packages and update the server to latest version.

OS Install Process 

VM :
- Cloud team will create the template for same OS version required to build.
- OS team will take the console and login to the server, if they doesn't have the root password to login , can break it.
- once login, need to set correct the hostname, IP Address and create the users & file systems as per the request.
- set the parameters like kernel , ulimits values etc …
- need to install the packages and agent as per the customer requirement.
- patch the server.


  104  cat /etc/redhat-release
  105  id oracle
  106  ulimit -a
  107  cat /etc/security/limits.conf
  108  cd /etc/systemd/
  109  ls
  110  cd
  111  cd /etc/sysctl.d/
  112  ls
  113  cat 99-initial-sysctl.conf
  114  ls
  115  cat 99-sysctl.conf
  116  pwd
  117  cat /etc/sysctl.conf
  118  history

PHY :

- If server is Physical machine 
- Need to configure the required hardware in DC rack.
- They need to enable the ports like network , storage .etc …
- DC engineering team need to configure the console with IP and logins.
- Take the console logins from DC team and check the access.
- Then connect the virtual media - load the DVD - boot - select boot options to - boot from cd/DVD - reset the server.
- when restart it will prompt the OS installation - create the LVM partition for OS file systems and install it further.
- Once installation is completed - set the hostname and IP address.
- once login remotely set correct the hostname, IP Address and create the users & file systems as per the request.
- set the parameters like kernel , ulimits values etc …
- need to install the packages and agent as per the customer requirement.
- patch the server.
- If users are belongs to IPA/AD/LDAP accordingly configure it from server end.
- Finally check everything fine or not and handover the server.
- Need to keep server in the monitoring and backup and patching cycle.
- then server will be in Live environment. 

=> Server Decommission:
=========================>

Server decommission means need to remove the servers from the environment.

- when customer doesn't require the APP/DB running on the server, he will create the request to remove the servers.
- Customer/Server owner need to provide the approval to decommission the server.
- create the decommission request once get approved.
1) Need to keep the server in maintenance mode.
2 Services need to be stopped from App/DB team.
3. OS team need to remove the file systems and handover the disks to cloud team and shutdown/powered off the server.
4. VM cloud team need delete the server from Vcentre/VMWare level.
5. need to remove the DNS configuration.
6. Network team will claim the IP address.

Physical:

1) Need to take the complete server backup.
2) Need to keep the server in maintenance mode/ remove it from monitoring.
3) Services need to be stopped from App/DB team.
4) need to delete the APP/DB configurations from the server.
5) OS team will remove the file systems and users from the server and handoverthe luns/disks to storage team.
6) os team need to power of the server.
7) storage team will claim the luns.
8) network team will claim the IP's
9) need to remove the DNS.
10) DC teams will remove the console and remove the hardware from DC and decompose the server/they will reuse for another servers.




==> Patching:
================================
Basically patching is to update the operating system up to date. if patch the server kernel and security and system packages will be updated and up date to.

We need to do the Linux patching on monthly basis to avoid the vulnerabilities and make secure environment.

Process :

We need to check with customer/server owner to confirm the schedule window to perform the patching.
Once get approval need to create the change request and get all the approvals like tech review , CAB , Customer ...etc.
also need to create a meting invite as per the schedule time.
Please send a mail to App/DB team on one day to before to know about the activity.
During the patching window - Please send mail to stop the services.
once services are stopped - request cloud team to take snapshot, if server is physical take backup.
once snapshot taken, please take a prechecks from servers and make sure to no issue at OS level.
then perform the patching # yum update -y and # reboot the server
once servers are up please do the validate from OS level and handover the server to App/DB team
Request DB/App team to bring up the services. once service and running fine. then we can close the change request.
If in case post patching any issues with Application with OS. Need to rollback the patching by using the snapshot.



==> Vulnerabilities:
===============================>

These  are weaknesses  in  the system  that  attackers can  exploit  to gain  unauthorized  access, disrupt  services,  or steal  data.  Here's a  breakdown  of what  they  are and  why  they matter:

- Misconfigurations:  Weak  or default  settings  in services  like  SSH, NFS,  or  Apache.
- Privilege  Escalation: Bugs  that  let users  gain  root access  (e.g.,  CVE-2023-52814).
- Remote Code  Execution  (RCE): Vulnerabilities  that  allow attackers  to  run code  remotely  (e.g., CVE-2024-42256).
- Authentication Bypass:  Flaws  that let  attackers  skip login  checks  (e.g., CVE-2023-52752).
- Supply Chain  Attacks:  Malicious code  inserted  into widely  used  open-source tools  (e.g.,  the XZ  Utils  backdoor).

Vulnerabilities will reported when system is not up to date.
when we receive request we need to validate the sheet and work on it based on the priority for remediation.



==> OS upgrades :
=======================

-> OS in place Upgrade Process:

OS upgrade means to upgrade the OS major versions like RHEL - 7->8->9 , OEL 7-8-9, SuSe 12- 15

Need to get the approval from customer.
App/DB team need to confirm that, whether they have compatibility with latest OS version or not.
If they are okay , we can proceed the activity as per the ITIL process.
also need to create a meting invite as per the schedule time.
Please send a mail to App/DB team on one day to before to know about the activity.
During the patching window - Please send mail to stop the services.
once services are stopped - request cloud team to take snapshot, if server is physical take backup.
once snapshot taken, please take a prechecks from servers and make sure to no issue at OS level.
make sure update the server latest kernel version before upgrade.

Commands:-

yum install leapp*
subscription-manager clean
subscription-manager register --org="multitenant" --activationkey="leapp" --server=satellite-dcd.secure-24.net
subscription-manager repos --list
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms 
yum install leapp*

- Once leap installed , GO to RHEL stellate server - change the content view to RHEL 7.9 to 8.8
leapp preupgrade   --target 8.8
leapp upgrade --target 8.8
subscription-manager status

once servers are up please do the validate from OS level and handover the server to App/DB team
Request DB/App team to bring up the services. once service and running fine. then we can close the change request.
If in case post patching any issues with Application with OS. Need to rollback the patching by using the snapshot.


--> OS migration with New server Build :

Here you need to build the new server with required version as per the build process and configure the as per the existing server.
Then do the cutover activity.

Cutover activity : 

-change need to be created and follow the process as per the schedule.

- Apps/DB will be stopped on OLD server
- DATA need to rsync from old to new servers.
- Then change the hostname and IP address from old to New server.
- Then request APP/DB team to start and validate the services.

Rollback :

- In case if any issues with New server, immediately they will power off the new server and power on the old server.
- then swap the Hostname and IP address.
- APP/DB team will start the services.
